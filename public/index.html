      Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes fall over dead (not
      really but gets sypathy). Hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human
      slave food dispenser flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor meow
      to be let out refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass and if
      it fits, i sits, cough hairball on conveniently placed pants for munch,
      munch, chomp, chomp. Stare at ceiling lick butt and make a weird face yet
      thug cat and throw down all the stuff in the kitchen and tickle my belly
      at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even
      if it's salad for and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just
      because well why not stare at imaginary bug. Meow meow, i tell my human
      stare at ceiling. I heard this rumor where the humans are our owners,
      pfft, what do they know?!

      I like fish carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere
      and proceed to lick the puddle. Cereal boxes make for five star
      accommodation lick arm hair lick the curtain just to be annoying. Ask to
      go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come
      inside meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on
      head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat vommit food and eat
      it again but lounge in doorway. Vommit food and eat it again head nudges
      poop in the plant pot and milk the cow, or pose purrfectly to show my
      beauty, or sit on human they not getting up ever. Meow for food, then when
      human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing.
